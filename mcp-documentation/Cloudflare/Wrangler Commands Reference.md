This page provides a reference for Wrangler commands.

```txt
wrangler <COMMAND> <SUBCOMMAND> [PARAMETERS] [OPTIONS]
```

Since Cloudflare recommends [installing Wrangler locally](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/install-and-update/) in your project(rather than globally), the way to run Wrangler will depend on your specific setup and package manager.

- [npm](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/commands/#tab-panel-2596)
- [yarn](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/commands/#tab-panel-2597)
- [pnpm](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/commands/#tab-panel-2598)

```sh
npx wrangler <COMMAND> <SUBCOMMAND> [PARAMETERS] [OPTIONS]
```

You can add Wrangler commands that you use often as scripts in your project's `package.json` file:

```json
{
  ...
  "scripts": {
    "deploy": "wrangler deploy",
    "dev": "wrangler dev"
  }
  ...
}
```

You can then run them using your package manager of choice:

- [npm](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/commands/#tab-panel-2599)
- [yarn](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/commands/#tab-panel-2600)
- [pnpm](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/commands/#tab-panel-2601)

```sh
npm run deploy
```

```

## kv bulk

Manage multiple key-value pairs within a Workers KV namespace in batches.

### put

Write a JSON file containing an array of key-value pairs to the given namespace.

```txt
wrangler kv bulk put <FILENAME> {--binding=<BINDING>|--namespace-id=<NAMESPACE_ID>} [OPTIONS]
```

- `FILENAME` string required
	- The JSON file containing an array of key-value pairs to write to the namespace.
- `--binding` string
	- The binding name of the namespace, as stored in the Wrangler file, to write to.
- `--namespace-id` string
	- The ID of the namespace to write to.
- `--env` string optional
	- Perform on a specific environment.
- `--preview` boolean optional
	- Interact with a preview namespace instead of production.
- `--local` boolean (default: true) optional
	- Interact with locally persisted data.
- `--remote` boolean (default: false) optional
	- Interact with remote storage.
- `--persist-to` string optional
	- Specify directory for locally persisted data.

The following global flags work on every command:

- `--help` boolean
	- Show help.
- `--config` string (not supported by Pages)
	- Path to your [Wrangler configuration file](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/configuration/).
- `--cwd` string
	- Run as if Wrangler was started in the specified directory instead of the current working directory.

This command takes a JSON file as an argument with a list of key-value pairs to upload. An example of JSON input:

```json
[
  {
    "key": "test_key",
    "value": "test_value",
    "expiration_ttl": 3600
  }
]
```

KV namespace values can only store strings. In order to save complex a value, stringify it to JSON:

```json
[
  {
    "key": "test_key",
    "value": "{\"name\": \"test_value\"}",
    "expiration_ttl": 3600
  }
]
```

Refer to the full schema for key-value entries uploaded via the bulk API:

- `key` string required
	- The key’s name. The name may be 512 bytes maximum. All printable, non-whitespace characters are valid.
- `value` string required
	- The UTF-8 encoded string to be stored, up to 25 MB in length.
- `metadata` object optional
	- Any arbitrary object (must serialize to JSON) to a maximum of 1,024 bytes.
- `expiration` number optional
	- The time, measured in number of seconds since the UNIX epoch, at which the key should expire.
- `expiration_ttl` number optional
	- The number of seconds the document should exist before expiring. Must be at least `60` seconds.
- `base64` boolean optional
	- When true, the server will decode the value as base64 before storing it. This is useful for writing values that would otherwise be invalid JSON strings, such as images. Defaults to `false`.

The following is an example of writing all the key-value pairs found in the `allthethingsupload.json` file.

```sh
npx wrangler kv bulk put --binding=MY_KV allthethingsupload.json
```

```sh
Success!
```

### delete

Delete all keys read from a JSON file within a given namespace.

```txt
wrangler kv bulk delete <FILENAME> {--binding=<BINDING>|--namespace-id=<NAMESPACE_ID>} [OPTIONS]
```

- `FILENAME` string required
	- The JSON file containing an array of keys to delete from the namespace.
- `--binding` string
	- The binding name of the namespace, as stored in the Wrangler file, to delete from.
- `--namespace-id` string
	- The ID of the namespace to delete from.
- `--env` string optional
	- Perform on a specific environment.
- `--preview` boolean optional
	- Interact with a preview namespace instead of production.
- `--local` boolean (default: true) optional
	- Interact with locally persisted data.
- `--remote` boolean (default: false) optional
	- Interact with remote storage.
- `--persist-to` string optional
	- Specify directory for locally persisted data.

The following global flags work on every command:

- `--help` boolean
	- Show help.
- `--config` string (not supported by Pages)
	- Path to your [Wrangler configuration file](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/configuration/).
- `--cwd` string
	- Run as if Wrangler was started in the specified directory instead of the current working directory.

This command takes a JSON file as an argument containing the keys to delete.

The following is an example of the JSON input:

```json
["test_key_1", "test_key_2"]
```

The command also accepts keys in the format output from `wrangler kv key list`:

```json
[{ "name": "test_key_1" }, { "name": "test_key_2" }]
```

The following is an example of deleting all the keys found in the `allthethingsdelete.json` file.

```sh
npx wrangler kv bulk delete --binding=MY_KV allthethingsdelete.json
```

```sh
? Are you sure you want to delete all keys in allthethingsdelete.json from kv-namespace with id "f7b02e7fc70443149ac906dd81ec1791"? › (Y/n)
Success!

## secret

Manage the secret variables for a Worker.

This action creates a new [version](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/configuration/versions-and-deployments/#versions) of the Worker and [deploys](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/configuration/versions-and-deployments/#deployments) it immediately. To only create a new version of the Worker, use the [`wrangler versions secret`](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/commands/#secret-put) commands.

### put

```txt
wrangler secret put <KEY> [OPTIONS]
```

- `KEY` string required
	- The variable name for this secret to be accessed in the Worker.

- `--cwd` string
	- Run as if Wrangler was started in the specified directory instead of the current working directory.

When running this command, you will be prompted to input the secret's value:

```sh
npx wrangler secret put FOO
```

```sh
? Enter a secret value: › ***
🌀 Creating the secret for script worker-app
✨ Success! Uploaded secret FOO
```

The `put` command can also receive piped input. For example:

```sh
echo "-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----\nM...==\n-----END PRIVATE KEY-----\n" | wrangler secret put PRIVATE_KEY
```

If Wrangler fails to open a browser, you can copy and paste the URL generated by `wrangler login` in your terminal into a browser and log in.

If you are using Wrangler from a remote machine, but run the login flow from your local browser, you will receive the following error message after logging in:`This site can't be reached`.

To finish the login flow, run `wrangler login` and go through the login flow in the browser:

```sh
⛅️ wrangler 2.1.6
-------------------
Opening a link in your default browser: https://dash.cloudflare.com/oauth2/auth?xyz...
```

The browser login flow will redirect you to a `localhost` URL on your machine.

Leave the login flow active. Open a second terminal session. In that second terminal session, use `curl` or an equivalent request library on the remote machine to fetch this `localhost` URL. Copy and paste the `localhost` URL that was generated during the `wrangler login` flow and run:

```sh
curl <LOCALHOST_URL>
```

## mtls-certificate

Manage client certificates used for mTLS connections in subrequests.

These certificates can be used in [`mtls_certificate` bindings](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/runtime-apis/bindings/mtls), which allow a Worker to present the certificate when establishing a connection with an origin that requires client authentication (mTLS).

### upload

Upload a client certificate.

```txt
wrangler mtls-certificate upload --cert <PATH> --key <PATH> [OPTIONS]
```

- `--cert` string required
	- A path to the TLS certificate to upload. Certificate chains are supported.
- `--key` string required
	- A path to the private key to upload.
- `--name` string optional
	- The name assigned to the mTLS certificate at upload.

The following global flags work on every command:

- `--help` boolean

The following is an example of using the `upload` command to upload an mTLS certificate.

```sh
npx wrangler mtls-certificate upload --cert cert.pem --key key.pem --name my-origin-cert
```

```sh
Uploading mTLS Certificate my-origin-cert...
Success! Uploaded mTLS Certificate my-origin-cert
ID: 99f5fef1-6cc1-46b8-bd79-44a0d5082b8d
Issuer: CN=my-secured-origin.com,OU=my-team,O=my-org,L=San Francisco,ST=California,C=US
Expires: 1/01/2025
```

You can then add this certificate as a [binding](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/runtime-apis/bindings/) in your [Wrangler configuration file](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/configuration/):

- [wrangler.jsonc](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/commands/#tab-panel-2602)
- [wrangler.toml](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/commands/#tab-panel-2603)

```jsonc
{
  "mtls_certificates": [
    {
      "binding": "MY_CERT",
      "certificate_id": "99f5fef1-6cc1-46b8-bd79-44a0d5082b8d"
    }
  ]
}
```

Note that the certificate and private keys must be in separate (typically `.pem`) files when uploading.

## types

Generate types based on your Worker configuration, including `Env` types based on your bindings, module rules, and [runtime types](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/languages/typescript/) based on the `compatibility_date` and `compatibility_flags` in your [config file](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/configuration/).

```txt
wrangler types [<PATH>] [OPTIONS]
```

- `PATH` string (default: \`./worker-configuration.d.ts\`)
	- The path to where types for your Worker will be written.
	- The path must have a `d.ts` extension.
- `--env-interface` string (default: \`Env\`)
	- The name of the interface to generate for the environment object.
	- Not valid if the Worker uses the Service Worker syntax.
- `--include-runtime` boolean (default: true)
	- Whether to generate runtime types based on the `compatibility_date` and `compatibility_flags` in your [config file](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/configuration/).
- `--include-env` boolean (default: true)
	- Whether to generate `Env` types based on your Worker bindings.
- `--strict-vars` boolean optional (default: true)
	- Control the types that Wrangler generates for `vars` bindings.
	- If `true`, (the default) Wrangler generates literal and union types for bindings (e.g. `myVar: 'my dev variable' | 'my prod variable'`).
	- If `false`, Wrangler generates generic types (e.g. `myVar: string`). This is useful when variables change frequently, especially when working across multiple environments.
- `--config`, `-c` string\[\] optional
	- Path(s) to [Wrangler configuration file](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/configuration/). If the Worker you are generating types for has service bindings or bindings to Durable Objects, you can also provide the paths to those configuration files so that the generated `Env` type will include RPC types. For example, given a Worker with a service binding, `wrangler types -c wrangler.toml -c ../bound-worker/wrangler.toml` will generate an `Env` type like this:
	```ts
	interface Env {
	  SERVICE_BINDING: Service<import("../bound-worker/src/index").Entrypoint>;
	}
	```

## telemetry

Cloudflare collects anonymous usage data to improve Wrangler. You can learn more about this in our [data policy ↗](https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-sdk/tree/main/packages/wrangler/telemetry.md).

You can manage sharing of usage data at any time using these commands.

### disable

Disable telemetry collection for Wrangler.

```txt
wrangler telemetry disable
```

### enable

Enable telemetry collection for Wrangler.

```txt
wrangler telemetry enable
```

### status

Check whether telemetry collection is currently enabled. The return result is specific to the directory where you have run the command.

This will resolve the global status set by `wrangler telemetry disable / enable`, the environment variable [`WRANGLER_SEND_METRICS`](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/system-environment-variables/#supported-environment-variables), and the [`send_metrics`](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/configuration/#top-level-only-keys) key in the [Wrangler configuration file](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/configuration/).

```txt
wrangler telemetry status
```

The following global flags work on every command:

- `--help` boolean
	- Show help.
- `--config` string (not supported by Pages)
	- Path to your [Wrangler configuration file](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/configuration/).
- `--cwd` string
	- Run as if Wrangler was started in the specified directory instead of the current working directory.

---

## check

### startup

Generate a CPU profile of your Worker's startup phase.

After you run `wrangler check startup`, you can import the profile into Chrome DevTools or open it directly in VSCode to view a flamegraph of your Worker's startup phase. Additionally, when a Worker deployment fails with a startup time error Wrangler will automatically generate a CPU profile for easy investigation.

```sh
wrangler check startup
```

- `--args` string optional
	- To customise the way `wrangler check startup` builds your Worker for analysis, provide the exact arguments you use when deploying your Worker with `wrangler deploy`, or your Pages project with `wrangler pages functions build`. For instance, if you deploy your Worker with `wrangler deploy --no-bundle`, you should use `wrangler check startup --args="--no-bundle"` to profile the startup phase.
- `--worker` string optional
	- If you don't use Wrangler to deploy your Worker, you can use this argument to provide a Worker bundle to analyse. This should be a file path to a serialized multipart upload, with the exact same format as [the API expects](https://developers.cloudflare.com/api/resources/workers/subresources/scripts/methods/update/).
- `--pages` boolean optional
	- If you don't use a Wrangler config file with your Pages project (i.e. a Wrangler config file containing `pages_build_output_dir`), use this flag to force `wrangler check startup` to treat your project as a Pages project.

The following global flags work on every command:

- `--help` boolean
	- Show help.
- `--config` string (not supported by Pages)
	- Path to your [Wrangler configuration file](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/configuration/).
- `--cwd` string
	- Run as if Wrangler was started in the specified directory instead of the current working directory.
