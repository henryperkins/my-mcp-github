Claude Code can connect to hundreds of external tools and data sources through the [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction), an open-source standard for AI-tool integrations. MCP servers give Claude Code access to your tools, databases, and APIs.

## What you can do with MCP

With MCP servers connected, you can ask Claude Code to:

- **Implement features from issue trackers**: “Add the feature described in JIRA issue ENG-4521 and create a PR on GitHub.”
- **Analyze monitoring data**: “Check Sentry and Statsig to check the usage of the feature described in ENG-4521.”
- **Query databases**: “Find emails of 10 random users who used feature ENG-4521, based on our Postgres database.”
- **Integrate designs**: “Update our standard email template based on the new Figma designs that were posted in Slack”
- **Automate workflows**: “Create Gmail drafts inviting these 10 users to a feedback session about the new feature.”

Here are some commonly used MCP servers you can connect to Claude Code:

Use third party MCP servers at your own risk - Anthropic has not verified the correctness or security of all these servers. Make sure you trust MCP servers you are installing. Be especially careful when using MCP servers that could fetch untrusted content, as these can expose you to prompt injection risk.

## Installing MCP servers

MCP servers can be configured in three different ways depending on your needs:

### Option 1: Add a local stdio server

Stdio servers run as local processes on your machine. They’re ideal for tools that need direct system access or custom scripts.

### Option 2: Add a remote SSE server

SSE (Server-Sent Events) servers provide real-time streaming connections. Many cloud services use this for live updates.

### Option 3: Add a remote HTTP server

HTTP servers use standard request/response patterns. Most REST APIs and web services use this transport.

### Managing your servers

Once configured, you can manage your MCP servers with these commands:

Tips:

- Use the `--scope` flag to specify where the configuration is stored:
	- `local` (default): Available only to you in the current project (was called `project` in older versions)
	- `project`: Shared with everyone in the project via `.mcp.json` file
	- `user`: Available to you across all projects (was called `global` in older versions)
- Set environment variables with `--env` flags (e.g., `--env KEY=value`)
- Configure MCP server startup timeout using the MCP\_TIMEOUT environment variable (e.g., `MCP_TIMEOUT=10000 claude` sets a 10-second timeout)
- Use `/mcp` to authenticate with remote servers that require OAuth 2.0 authentication

**Windows Users**: On native Windows (not WSL), local MCP servers that use `npx` require the `cmd /c` wrapper to ensure proper execution.

Without the `cmd /c` wrapper, you’ll encounter “Connection closed” errors because Windows cannot directly execute `npx`.

## MCP installation scopes

MCP servers can be configured at three different scope levels, each serving distinct purposes for managing server accessibility and sharing. Understanding these scopes helps you determine the best way to configure servers for your specific needs.

### Local scope

Local-scoped servers represent the default configuration level and are stored in your project-specific user settings. These servers remain private to you and are only accessible when working within the current project directory. This scope is ideal for personal development servers, experimental configurations, or servers containing sensitive credentials that shouldn’t be shared.

### Project scope

Project-scoped servers enable team collaboration by storing configurations in a `.mcp.json` file at your project’s root directory. This file is designed to be checked into version control, ensuring all team members have access to the same MCP tools and services. When you add a project-scoped server, Claude Code automatically creates or updates this file with the appropriate configuration structure.

The resulting `.mcp.json` file follows a standardized format:

For security reasons, Claude Code prompts for approval before using project-scoped servers from `.mcp.json` files. If you need to reset these approval choices, use the `claude mcp reset-project-choices` command.

### User scope

User-scoped servers provide cross-project accessibility, making them available across all projects on your machine while remaining private to your user account. This scope works well for personal utility servers, development tools, or services you frequently use across different projects.

### Choosing the right scope

Select your scope based on:

- **Local scope**: Personal servers, experimental configurations, or sensitive credentials specific to one project
- **Project scope**: Team-shared servers, project-specific tools, or services required for collaboration
- **User scope**: Personal utilities needed across multiple projects, development tools, or frequently-used services

### Scope hierarchy and precedence

MCP server configurations follow a clear precedence hierarchy. When servers with the same name exist at multiple scopes, the system resolves conflicts by prioritizing local-scoped servers first, followed by project-scoped servers, and finally user-scoped servers. This design ensures that personal configurations can override shared ones when needed.

### Environment variable expansion in.mcp.json

Claude Code supports environment variable expansion in `.mcp.json` files, allowing teams to share configurations while maintaining flexibility for machine-specific paths and sensitive values like API keys.

**Supported syntax:**

- `${VAR}` - Expands to the value of environment variable `VAR`
- `${VAR:-default}` - Expands to `VAR` if set, otherwise uses `default`

**Expansion locations:**Environment variables can be expanded in:

- `command` - The server executable path
- `args` - Command-line arguments
- `env` - Environment variables passed to the server
- `url` - For SSE/HTTP server types
- `headers` - For SSE/HTTP server authentication

**Example with variable expansion:**

If a required environment variable is not set and has no default value, Claude Code will fail to parse the config.

## Practical examples

## Authenticate with remote MCP servers

Many cloud-based MCP servers require authentication. Claude Code supports OAuth 2.0 for secure connections.

Tips:

- Authentication tokens are stored securely and refreshed automatically
- Use “Clear authentication” in the `/mcp` menu to revoke access
- If your browser doesn’t open automatically, copy the provided URL
- OAuth authentication works with both SSE and HTTP transports

## Add MCP servers from JSON configuration

If you have a JSON configuration for an MCP server, you can add it directly:

Tips:

- Make sure the JSON is properly escaped in your shell
- The JSON must conform to the MCP server configuration schema
- You can use `--scope global` to add the server to your global configuration instead of the project-specific one

## Import MCP servers from Claude Desktop

If you’ve already configured MCP servers in Claude Desktop, you can import them:

Tips:

- This feature only works on macOS and Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)
- It reads the Claude Desktop configuration file from its standard location on those platforms
- Use the `--scope global` flag to add servers to your global configuration
- Imported servers will have the same names as in Claude Desktop
- If servers with the same names already exist, they will get a numerical suffix (e.g., `server_1`)

## Use Claude Code as an MCP server

You can use Claude Code itself as an MCP server that other applications can connect to:

You can use this in Claude Desktop by adding this configuration to claude\_desktop\_config.json:

Tips:

- The server provides access to Claude’s tools like View, Edit, LS, etc.
- In Claude Desktop, try asking Claude to read files in a directory, make edits, and more.
- Note that this MCP server is simply exposing Claude Code’s tools to your MCP client, so your own client is responsible for implementing user confirmation for individual tool calls.

## Use MCP resources

MCP servers can expose resources that you can reference using @ mentions, similar to how you reference files.

### Reference MCP resources

Tips:

- Resources are automatically fetched and included as attachments when referenced
- Resource paths are fuzzy-searchable in the @ mention autocomplete
- Claude Code automatically provides tools to list and read MCP resources when servers support them
- Resources can contain any type of content that the MCP server provides (text, JSON, structured data, etc.)

## Use MCP prompts as slash commands

MCP servers can expose prompts that become available as slash commands in Claude Code.

### Execute MCP prompts

Tips:

- MCP prompts are dynamically discovered from connected servers
- Arguments are parsed based on the prompt’s defined parameters
- Prompt results are injected directly into the conversation
- Server and prompt names are normalized (spaces become underscores)
