## Key Findings

### Strengths

1. **Clean JSON Structure**
   - Consistent OData formatting across all responses
   - Proper use of @odata.context and @odata.etag
   - Well-structured nested objects for complex configurations

2. **Comprehensive Data Coverage**
   - Full Azure Search API feature support
   - Detailed configuration information
   - Proper metadata inclusion

3. **Intelligent Response Management**
   - Automatic summarization for responses >20KB
   - Clear indicators when summarization occurs
   - Preservation of critical information in summaries

4. **Error Handling**
   - Clear error messages (e.g., "Index 'codebase-mcp-sota' does not exist")
   - Transient failure reporting with actionable context
   - Document-level error details in indexer status

5. **Performance**
   - Fast response times across all operations
   - Efficient handling of large datasets
   - Proper pagination support

### Areas for Improvement

1. **Synonym Map Readability**
   - Current format shows escaped newlines making it difficult to parse
   - Example: `"synonyms": "f\\nu\\nn\\nc\\n,\\n \\nf\\nu\\nn\\nc\\nt\\ni\\no\\nn"`
   - Would benefit from proper formatting

2. **Vector Index Size Reporting**
   - Shows `"vectorIndexSize": 0` despite having vector fields
   - May indicate incomplete vector indexing or reporting issue

3. **Response Formatting**
   - Some responses could benefit from optional simplified views
   - Complex nested structures (like field definitions) could have summary modes

## Test Results Detail

### Test 1: List Indexes with Stats
```json
{
  "indexes": [
    {
      "name": "my-mcp-github-repo",
      "fields": 6,
      "semanticSearchEnabled": true,
      "vectorSearchEnabled": true,
      "documentCount": 10,
      "storageSize": 68652
    },
    {
      "name": "test-orderby-fix",
      "fields": 12,
      "documentCount": 2,
      "storageSize": 17917
    }
  ],
  "count": 2
}
```
**Result:** ✅ Successful - All index metadata properly displayed

### Test 2: Document Search
```json
{
  "@odata.count": 10,
  "value": [/* 5 documents returned */]
}
```
**Result:** ✅ Successful - Search, pagination, and field selection working

### Test 3: Index Schema Retrieval
- Successfully retrieved complete field definitions
- Vector search profiles properly configured
- Semantic search configuration present
**Result:** ✅ Successful - Full schema accessible

### Test 4: Indexer Status
- Large response (103KB) automatically summarized
- Key errors and metrics preserved in summary
- Execution history included
**Result:** ✅ Successful - Intelligent summarization working

### Test 5: Synonym Maps
- Retrieved synonym map configuration
- Format issues noted but data accessible
**Result:** ⚠️ Partial - Data available but formatting needs improvement

## Recommendations

### High Priority

1. **Fix Synonym Map Formatting**
   - Parse and format synonym definitions for readability
   - Consider returning as array or structured format
   - Add option for raw vs formatted output

2. **Investigate Vector Index Size**
   - Verify vector index statistics calculation
   - Ensure proper reporting of vector storage usage
   - Add diagnostic information if vectors aren't indexed

3. **Enhance Error Messages**
   - Add suggested actions for common errors
   - Include links to documentation where relevant
   - Provide error codes for programmatic handling

### Medium Priority

4. **Add Response Format Options**
   - Implement `format` parameter (full/summary/minimal)
   - Allow field filtering on complex responses
   - Add option to exclude OData metadata

5. **Improve Large Response Handling**
   - Add progress indicators for long-running operations
   - Implement streaming for very large result sets
   - Provide clear size warnings before summarization

6. **Enhance Tool Documentation**
